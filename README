Slider3D -- 3D Photo Slide Show (prototype)
Copyright (c) 2009, Mihail Szabolcs

QT+OpenGL

UPDATE: 8/16/2009
    * added configuration dialog with many configurable options

Features (as of now):

    * scans the current directory for photos (png & jpg)
    * resizes photos internally before converting them to textures to either 512x512 or 1024x0124; so it should work fine with most video cards.
    * keeps the original aspect ratio of the photos
    * tries to activate and use 4x multi-sampling (anti-aliasing) if possible
    * multi-monitor support (by passing in the command line arguments --monitor X ; where X is the desired monitor to use)
    * simple floor reflection using the Stencil Buffer (it may not work with not T&L cards)
    * scrolling left/right by using the arrow keys
    * automatic slide show mode can be switched on / off by pressing 'space' (switches every 3 seconds; two way)
    * displays file names under the current photo
